Movie-Analyser
==============

Java programm for the research "The ratio of different colours in films and videos".

The program that was written during the research made it possible to collect the colour ratio statistics of any video or film. With the help of the statistics one can now analyze the psychological influence of colours in films affecting people on the basis of a concrete not subjective data. In virtue of this work more thorough further research could be made.

As a result, a lot of work has been done; the purpose of the study was achieved as well as all the tasks have been implemented. Moreover, the new ideas on the subject were appearing during the research by which it has been constantly evolving and the work became more and more interesting.

In consequence of the work done invaluable experience and ability to process statistical data, build graphs using the Java programming language features, analyze them and to carry out a psychological analysis and draw conclusions was acquired.

In addition, I learned how to use literature and online sources effectively for finding information and solving problems. All of these skills and experiences will help me to work more effectively on other studies or projects in the future.
